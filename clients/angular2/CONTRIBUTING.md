## Submitting Pull Requests
It's very welcomed for you to contribute to this starter by sending a pull request, and
to make sure the process run smoothly, I'd like you to follow these guidelines:

### General
* Please rebase your branch against the current master
* Make sure you have the latest dependencies installed by running `npm install` before
* All tests must passed, and not lowering coverage percentage
* Link to the related [issues](https://github.com/antonybudianto/angular2-starter/issues) to automatically close the issue when it's merged 
  * **example:** *fix #123* in the pull request body message
* Use semantic commit message where possible
* Only 1 commit per pull request is acceptable, so always rebase it

### New features
* Please file an issue **first** to discuss it. If it's accepted, then you can continue to work on the pull request
* Always include the unit test
